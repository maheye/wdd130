        Why?
        My company has just come to Taiwan for development and does not have a Chinese website.
        The industry competition is fiercer, need to enhance the strength of their own company, show the company's brand image, so the website is essential. If there is no website, a lot of potential customers will be lost. First, it can expand its business scope. The website can conduct online transactions, providing convenience for customers and breaking the limitation of time and space. Second, the site can serve the existing customers, while winning more new customers. In addition, the website can also reduce costs, reduce advertising expenses and other expenses.
      </p>
      <p>
        The core purpose of the website:
        It is to attract users who visit the website through the page layout and visual effects of the website, get in touch with business owners, and obtain business opportunities through the website. Moreover, for some foreign trade companies, bilingual or multilingual websites are generally made, mainly for their own business groups, to facilitate foreign customers to browse and inquire.
